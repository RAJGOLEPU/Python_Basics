## Getting Started with Python

If you are new to Python, it's essential to start with the basics. Here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Learn how to install Python on your system.
- [Python Interactive Shell](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html): Discover the Python interactive shell and start writing your first Python commands.
- [Python IDEs](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/): Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write Python code effectively.

## Python Basics

Once you have Python installed and are familiar with the basics, you can dive into fundamental Python concepts, including:

- [Variables and Data Types](fundamentals.ipynb)
- [Operators](basics/operators.md)
- [Control Structures](basics/control_structures.md)
- [Functions](basics/functions.md)
- [Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries](basics/lists_tuples_dictionaries.md)
- [Working with Files](basics/working_with_files.md)

## Intermediate Python

After mastering the basics, it's time to explore more advanced Python topics:

- [Object-Oriented Programming](intermediate/oop.md)
- [Error Handling](intermediate/error_handling.md)
